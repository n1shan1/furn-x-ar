## Introduction

Introducing our augmented reality application that allows you to visualize furniture in real time, bringing your interior design visions to life. With our app, you can easily preview furniture in your own space, adjust size and placement, and get a realistic feel for how it will look before making any changes. Whether you're an interior designer, architect, or simply someone who enjoys experimenting with different design ideas, our app offers a seamless and immersive experience that allows you to unleash your creativity and explore endless possibilities. 

## Tech Stack

The application is based on Unity and is native to Android Operating System. It makes use of the Vuforia engine for ground plane detection, marker-less and marker-based. The overall application is scripted in C# language in unity.

We have used Ground Plane Detection which allows the application to detect the plane and simultaneously project the AR models in real time via the app.

## Functionality

This app lets the user to view the required furniture in real time in their space, allowing them to actually view the furniture space allocation without actually owning the furniture physically. 

We have planned to include the option for the user to buy the particular furniture if the like the same, with pricing and reviews. A cart feature has been planned to be included in the same, which will help the customers to  actually buy more products at the same time.

## Business Model

After the application has been completed and all the features have been implemented, we are planning to launch the application in the application market (Google Play Store) for the public.
