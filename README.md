### Introduction

Introducing our augmented reality application that allows you to visualize furniture in real time, bringing your interior design visions to life. With our app, you can easily preview furniture in your own space, adjust size and placement, and get a realistic feel for how it will look before making any changes. Whether you're an interior designer, architect, or simply someone who enjoys experimenting with different design ideas, our app offers a seamless and immersive experience that allows you to unleash your creativity and explore endless possibilities. 

### The Problem

Despite advancements in online furniture shopping, customers still face challenges in visualizing how a piece of furniture will look and fit in their home. Traditional 2D images or videos can be inadequate in providing an accurate representation of the size, scale, and style of the furniture. This can result in a lack of confidence in purchasing decisions, high rates of return, and ultimately, dissatisfaction with the shopping experience. Therefore, there is a need for an AR furniture application that can provide customers with an immersive and interactive experience, allowing them to virtually place furniture in their home environment and visualize how it will look and fit before making a purchase.

### Our Solution

To tackle the same, we have designed the AR based application which helps the user to view the particular selected furniture to be viewd in real time in actual space, giving the user a virtual experience of the actual exixtance of the funiture in the area, allowing the user to have an almost accurate idea about the existance of the furniture in the plane.

### Tech Stack

The application is based on Unity and is native to Android Operating System. It makes use of the Vuforia engine for ground plane detection, marker-less and marker-based. The overall application is scripted in C# language in unity.

We have used Ground Plane Detection which allows the application to detect the plane and simultaneously project the AR models in real-time via the app

### Functionality

The AR Furniture Application offers users the ability to view furniture in real-time, allowing them to visualize how the furniture would look in their space without actually owning the furniture physically. This feature offers users an opportunity to experiment with furniture placement and space allocation, which is especially useful for those who are in the process of moving or redecorating.

Moreover, the application includes a purchasing feature that allows users to buy furniture they like. The app displays pricing and reviews of each piece of furniture, giving users the necessary information to make informed purchasing decisions. This feature enables users to make the purchase process more efficient by eliminating the need to visit a physical store, as well as helping to reduce the risk of buyer's remorse by providing ample information and reviews for each item.

To further improve the purchasing experience, a cart feature will be integrated into the application. This will allow customers to add multiple items to their cart and purchase them at the same time. This feature makes the purchase process more convenient for customers, as they can avoid multiple transactions and potentially save on shipping costs.

Overall, the AR Furniture Application offers an engaging and efficient shopping experience for users, with the added benefit of visualization through AR technology. The purchasing and cart features provide a seamless experience for customers, further enhancing the app's appeal and value.
